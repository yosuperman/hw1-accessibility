# Code Refactor Starter Code

In this assignment I learned how to navigate creating / duplicating / removing / mirroring / recloning GitHub repositories so that I could upload my refactored, accessible web page.

The goal of this assignment was to trouble-shoot issues with a provided site, make it comply with accessibility standards and clean-up the CSS code.

The link to my final verison is here: https://yosuperman.github.io/hw1-accessibility/

The User Story we were meeting is:

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Our Acceptance Criteria was:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

I had to make three different repositories before I got this right, so several committs were deleted. But trust they were there!
